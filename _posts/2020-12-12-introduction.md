Blog posting isn't something that I do and isn't something that I am all that good at (at the moment at least).
Although I am currently a masters student, which involves quite a bit of writing, both my thesis and other academic papers, writing is not one of my strongest skills.
So I am sure that any of these posts that I write are going to be _full_ of spelling and grammar errors.

So back to the main point of this post, why on earth am I doing this if I am not the greatest writer in the world and I don't even like writing all that much?
Because I am not writing this for other people to read.
Most, or even all, of these are going to be written about topics that interest me or are about a problem that I faced and these are my notes so that when I have to do it again all of the notes and walk through information is in one spot.
