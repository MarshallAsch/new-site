This is the mesh networking app that I built with [Weihan Li](https://github.com/weihanli101)
while working for [Left](https://left.io). The app is a basic forum platform where
users are able to create posts (with a title, message and tags) that other users are able to
then see and reply to. The basis for the app is to create a platform that is somewhat similar
to Stack Overflow that does not rely on an internet connection or centralized data storage.
