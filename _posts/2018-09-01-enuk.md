The eNuk Program is an integrated environment and health monitoring app
designed with and for the Inuit of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut to streamline and
incorporate the communityâ€™s existing research efforts into a comprehensive
tech strategy for monitoring climatic changes. The Android app is currently
in beta-testing and the iOS app was set to be released in late 2019. While I
cannot share the code, feel free to check our more about the project, or see
the app prototype.
