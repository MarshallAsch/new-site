Farm To Fork is an application created by 30 undergraduate School of Computer Science students
at the University of Guelph in 2012 with a goal to increase the quality and quantity of
fresh food donated to local food banks by providing donors with real-time needs.
I worked on this project in CIS*4500 (Special Topics iOS Development) with
[Professor Dan Gillis](http://danielgillis.ca/)
and [Domenic Bianchi](https://www.domenic-bianchi.com/) to develop a mobile app.
