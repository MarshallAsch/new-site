Hello there, welcome to my new and improved website!

Now it seems that everyone and their dog has a website of their own.
The main purpose of this site is to show off all the random things I have done and projects I have worked on that I think are cool.
I am **NOT** a web developer, I am not a front end developer and I can barely even make a good looking page, thank goodness for people who can make user interfaces (and including the creators of this [site template](https://beautifuljekyll.com/)).

A big part of me deciding to create the website was not to have a website, but to have the domain name that the website is using. I sometimes use sub domains it to point at some services I run so I don't have to remember IP addresses (oh boy will that get worse once everything starts using IPv6 addresses).


I have recently decided I want to start writing some [blog posts](/blogs) as an exercise to improve my writing skills, and to force myself to actually make some notes about how I solved some problems that I'm bound to face again some day.
