subtitle: Who I am, and what I have on my corner of the Internet
---

My name is Marshall Asch (which you may have already guessed).

I am currently most of the way through my Masters of Computer Science at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/).
My focus is on Data storage in Mobile ad hoc Networks.


I am currently working with [Dr. Dan Gillis](http://danielgillis.ca/) on a project to help close the digital divide in Northern Canada and to help monitor the environment and health of individuals in an Inuit community in Rigolet, Labrador.

# Other interests

I really do love computers and anything that can be connected to the Internet.
I think its amazing that we can tell computers and they will do exactly what we tell them (although sometimes we don't tell them what we think we did).


I recently acquired a 3D printer and have started attempting to create my own smart home monitoring devices (there will be a new project post about this soon hopefully).


Outside of computers, I love dogs especially the two border collies that live with me, making and eating food, and nearly any hardware project.
In the summer I love being able to go out side and go Kayaking (yes I know computer scientists and the outdoors are traditionally mortal enemies).


For as long as I can remember I have loved doing things with my hands and making something useful.
I suppose that drive to always need to be making something useful is why I love what I do so much, I have just chosen to apply it to computers rather than physical objects. 
But I will maintain my love for all projects, from cooking an exciting dinner, to taking apart my car to add an aux cord or change my brakes, to hand etching glass bowls for my family. 
If there is something that I can do I would love to try it.
Do it because you _can_, not because you _should_.

### A bit about my history

I am not entirely a traditional "computer nerd" (although I very much am one, and I love it), I never really got super into video games, anime, or some of the other classics.
In fact, originally computer science is not what I wanted to do with my life.
I started off school wanting to go into medicine, and in the first semester of my undergrad degree I thought nope there is no way I am going to go through all these biology and chemistry classes.
And I dropped all of those classes and switched to computer science for my second year and I have been extremely happy with my choice. 
I did not give up all of my interest in the the sciences, I kept doing physics since I have always enjoyed that, to the bewilderment of my friends. 


Thanks to having an amazing professor and TA for one of third year courses ([Dr. Dan Gillis](https://danielgillis.wordpress.com/) and [Nic Durish](https://nicdurish.ca/)) I had an amazing opportunity to get involved with the [eNuk project](https://enuk.ca/) which I fell in love with and ended up being one of the main motivations for doing my masters. 


Around the same time as I started getting involved in the eNuk project I started wanting to get more involved with the school and the student body. 
I joined the computer science student club on campus, [SOCIS](https://socis.ca/), I really cannot express how big of an impact that that choice has had on me, the people I have met and remain friends with from SOCIS are have had a big impact on who I am now. 
I ended up running for an exec position with SOCIS, the system administrator, which began my descent down the rabbit hole into the realm od DevOps. 

By the time I started my Masters in 2019 I was hooked, I started messing around with some of my own servers to deploy some services for myself. 
I have gradually been scaling that up and expanding into various cloud providers to try out new things and play with the cool toys that they have to offer. 
After all who gets into tech without wanting to play with all the cool toys??

Now that I am finishing up my Masters degree, hopefully really soon, It has been a long tough process, which I have loved it, but I'm now ready to get out of academia (Sorry Dan no PhD for me, not yet anyway). 
Going into the field of DevOps is where I want to be to follow my passion to whatever stage comes next for me after a long 2 decades in school.
